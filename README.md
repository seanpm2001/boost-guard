# Boost Guard

Work in progress!

The Boost Guard is in charge of attesting that a user is indeed eligible to claim a boost (whether via vote incentive or vote bribe).

To run your own instance:
1. Make sure you have cargo and Rust installed: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
2. Clone the repository `gcl https://github.com/snapshot-labs/boost-guard.git`
3. Move to the directory `cd boost-guard`
4. Run the client: `cargo run --release`
5. Profit!
